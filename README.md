Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ian Hajra and I'm a 20 year old sophomore at Brown University. I am studying applied mathematics and computer science. I recently joined the ATLAS Research Group where I am improving the portability and usability of the PaSh ecosystem.
In my free time, I love to play jazz piano and have recently gotten into rock climbing!
