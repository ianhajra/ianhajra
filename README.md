Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ian Hajra and I am a 21-year-old rising senior at Brown University. My academic and professional interests lie in the intersections of applied math and computer science and in the construction of computer systems. I have a deep passion for these fields and look forward to exploring them both independently and professionally.
