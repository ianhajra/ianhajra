Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ian Hajra and I am a 20-year-old sophomore at Brown University. My academic and professional interests lie in the intersections of applied math and computer science and in the construction of computer systems. I have a profound interest in cryptography and cybersecurity, and am excited to further explore these dynamic fields.
