Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ian Hajra and I'm a 20 year old sophomore at Brown University. I am studying applied mathematics and computer science. I will be joining the Kim Lab at Roswell Park this summer, where I will be contributing to Bioinformatics efforts.
In my free time, I love to play jazz piano and have recently gotten into rock climbing!
